# Quick Fix to Get App Running

## Problem
Angular 20 is incorrectly detecting components as standalone when they're not, preventing the app from compiling.

## Temporary Solution
To see if the app runs at all, we need to comment out the problematic components from app.module.ts.

## Steps to Apply Fix

1. Open `src/app/app.module.ts`

2. Comment out these components in the declarations array:
   - All chart components (LineChartComponent, BarChartComponent, etc.)
   - CarouselComponent
   - ModalsComponent  
   - ProgressBarComponent
   - PaginationComponent
   - TooltipsPopoversComponent
   - RegularComponent
   - TablesMainComponent
   - ChartBoxes3Component
   - ControlsComponent
   - LayoutComponent
   - ChartjsComponent

3. Also comment out their imports at the top

4. Run `ng serve`

## What This Does
- Allows the core app structure to load
- You can test navigation, routing, and basic layout
- Charts and some UI components won't work

## Proper Fix Options

### Option 1: Downgrade to Angular 19
Angular 20 might have stricter component detection. Downgrading to 19 might resolve this.

### Option 2: Convert to Standalone Components
Modernize the app by converting all components to standalone (recommended for Angular 20).

### Option 3: Debug the Root Cause
- Check if there's a global configuration making Angular think components are standalone
- Look for any decorators or metadata that might be causing this
- Check if it's related to the ng2-charts library

## Testing After Fix
Once running, check:
- Dashboard loads
- Navigation works
- Bootstrap 5 styling (may need CSS class updates)
- NgRx store functionality
