## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Angular CLI

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/architectui-angular-free.git
cd architectui-angular-free
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
ng serve
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`

### Build for Production

```bash
ng build --prod
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Development Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ng serve` | Start development server at http://localhost:4200 |
| `ng build` | Build the project for production |
| `npm run build:prod` | Build for subdirectory deployment with correct base href |
| `ng test` | Run unit tests via Karma |
| `ng lint` | Run ESLint code analysis |
| `ng generate component <name>` | Generate a new component |

## Production Deployment

### For Subdirectory Deployment
When deploying to a subdirectory like `https://demo.dashboardpack.com/architectui-angular-free/`:

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

This command:
- Builds with production optimizations
- Sets base href to `/architectui-angular-free/`
- Outputs to `dist/architectui-angular-free/`

Then upload the contents of `dist/architectui-angular-free/` to your server's subdirectory.

### For Root Domain Deployment
When deploying to a root domain like `https://yourdomain.com/`:

```bash
ng build --configuration production
```

### Server Configuration

#### Apache (.htaccess)
An `.htaccess` file is included in the project root. Copy it to your deployment folder along with the built files.

#### Nginx
Add this to your server configuration:
```nginx
location /architectui-angular-free/ {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /architectui-angular-free/index.html;
}
```

### Important Deployment Notes

1. **After building with `npm run build:prod`:**
   - Upload all contents from `dist/architectui-angular-free/browser/`
   - The `.htaccess` file is automatically included in the build
   - Verify the base href in index.html is `/architectui-angular-free/`

2. **File Structure on Server:**
   ```
   /architectui-angular-free/
   ├── index.html (with correct base href)
   ├── favicon.ico
   ├── .htaccess (handles direct URL access)
   ├── main-*.js
   ├── polyfills-*.js
   ├── scripts-*.js
   ├── styles-*.css
   ├── assets/
   └── media/
   ```

3. **Direct URL Access Fix:**
   The `.htaccess` file ensures that direct links like `/architectui-angular-free/dashboards/analytics` work correctly by redirecting all routes to `index.html`, allowing Angular to handle the routing.
